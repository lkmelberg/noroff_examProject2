# Exam Project 2 - Holidaze - Noroff VOC

This is my final exam project for my frontend degree from Noroff :) We were to use what we have learned in our two years of studies and apply it to the project. The site is a accomodation booking site. It was created using React and Chakra UI.

## Project Brief / Description

### Goal

To take the skills learned over the last two years and take on an extensive project where the finished product should reflect the candidateâ€™s general development capabilities, in addition to visual and technical skills.
Brief

A newly launched accommodation booking site called Holidaze has approached you to develop a brand new front end for their application. While they have a list of required features, the design and user experience has not been specified. Working with the official API documentation, plan, design and build a modern front end accommodation booking application.
